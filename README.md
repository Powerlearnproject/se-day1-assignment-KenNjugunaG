#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Software engineering is the process of applying engineering processes, principles and tools to develop, test and maintain reliable, efficient and scalable software systems.
Software engineering is important because it enables development of reliable and stable software, reducing the likelihood of errors and system failures which is critical for real word software applications e.g. in software used in healthcare and finance.
It also ensures well-engineered software that can handle tasks faster, consuming fewer resources while delivering excellent user experience.
It also provides methodologies of creating scalable and adaptable software.
 Software engineering principles also simplify complex problems by breaking them down into manageable components.**

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**1.	The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s - 1970s) 
Description: Structured programming brought the idea to split programs into smaller, manageable, and reusable parts or functions. Impact: This change set the stage for modern programming methods by boosting readability, modularity, and effectiveness. It sparked the growth of structured programming languages such as Pascal, C, and later Java, which adopted these ideas. It also brought in key concepts like loops, conditionals, and subroutines, which are basic to writing clear and efficient code.

 2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s - 1990s)
 Description: Object-oriented programming (OOP) caused a revolution in software development by arranging code around objects instead of actions, and data instead of logic. This new way of thinking stressed the use of classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Impact: OOP made software more modular, reusable, and easier to keep up. Languages like Python, which supports OOP, became leaders in the software industry.

 3. The Growth of Agile Methods (2000s)
 Description: Agile methods came about as a response to the strict, step-by-step approaches of old-school software development models like the Waterfall model. Agile pushes for step-by-step development, teamwork, customer input, and flexibility throughout the process to create software.**

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
**The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software. It consists of several phases as listed below

1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis
Aims to grasp and record the exact needs for the software. It involves talking to stakeholders to collect their wants making detailed specs of what's required, and looking at these needs to make sure they're clear and doable.
Deliverable: Requirement Specification Document.

2. Design
Involves creating high level detailed design of the software and defining how each module of the software will function based on the gathered requirements.
This phase also includes selecting the technology stack and defining databases, user interfaces, and other components.
Deliverable: Design Document (which may include diagrams like ERDs, DFDs, and flowcharts).

3. Implementation (Coding)
Involves translating the design into executable code by writing the code using the chosen programming languages and technologies, following coding standards, and adhering to the design specifications.
Deliverable: The actual software product (source code).

4. Testing
Involves identifying and fixing any bugs or issues in the software and ensure it meets the requirements by conducting various levels of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing) to verify that the software functions correctly, is secure, and meets the specified requirements.
Deliverable: Test Reports.

5. Deployment
Involves releasing of the software to its users through installation of the software in the production environment, configuring settings, and migrating data if necessary. This phase may also include training end-users and preparing user manuals.
Deliverable: Deployed software in the production environment.

6. Maintenance
Involves ensuring  software continues to function correctly and efficiently after deployment by addressing any issues that may arise during its use, making updates and enhancements, and providing ongoing support to users.
Deliverable: Updated and maintained software, with patches, upgrades, and support documentation.**

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**Waterfall Methodology 
It is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) must be completed before moving on to the next. 
Waterfall is rigid and does not easily accommodate changes once the development process has started. If a change is needed, it often requires revisiting and modifying earlier phases.

Requirements in this methodology are defined upfront during the initial phase and are expected to be stable and complete with the entire project being planned before development begins and the project follows a fixed schedule and timeline.
The scope of the project must also well-defined from the beginning and any changes to the scope after the project has started can be costly and time-consuming.
Risks are addressed upfront during the planning phase. However, because of its rigidity, Waterfall model is less able to handle unexpected risks or changes during development.

The appropriate scenario for use of the waterfall methodology involve projects: 
I.	With Well-Defined Requirements: When the project requirements are well-understood, stable, and unlikely to change.
II.	In Regulated Industries with projects that require strict documentation and adherence to regulatory standards, such as government projects, healthcare, or aerospace eg developing a compliance-related system for a government agency, where requirements are fixed by law and extensive documentation is mandatory.
III.	In Short-Term Projects with a short and fixed timelines where the scope is clearly defined.

Agile Methodology is an iterative and incremental software development approach that breaks the project into small, manageable units called sprints or iterations. Each sprint involves a mini-SDLC, including planning, development, testing, and review.
The Methodology is highly flexible, allowing for continuous feedback, adaptation, and changes throughout the development process. It embraces change and encourages regular reassessment of requirements.
User Requirements are gathered continuously and can evolve throughout the project. The focus is on delivering working software and adapting to changing needs.
Planning is done at the beginning of each sprint, and the project is broken into smaller, flexible iterations.

The appropriate scenario for use of the agile methodology involve:
I.	Projects with evolving requirements
II.	Customer-Centric Products: Projects where customer feedback is crucial, and there is a need for regular updates and changes.
III.	Innovation-Driven Projects: Projects focused on innovation, such as startups developing new products or services, where flexibility and speed are key. E.g Developing a mobile app for a startup, where user feedback and market demands are continuously changing, requiring rapid iterations and adaptability.**

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
**Software Developers have the job of creating, writing, checking, and updating software programs. They change project needs and plans into working code

Quality Assurance Engineers make sure that the software works well by finding mistakes, checking if it meets the necessary standards, and confirming that it is dependable, fast, and easy to use.

Project Managers are in charge of managing the whole process of creating software. They make sure the project is completed on schedule, stays within the planned limits, and stays within the budget while also meeting the needed quality levels.**

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – This is a special type of software that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Eg Visual Studio. IDEs also provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error detection, which help developers write correct and optimized code faster.

Version Control Systems (VCS) – This is a software tool used for tracking changes to a source code & coordinating work among team members. They enable effective collaboration, change tracking, and project management, ensuring that teams can work together efficiently while maintaining a reliable history of the codebase.**

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
**1. Meeting Tight Deadlines
Challenge: Balancing quality and speed while adhering to project timelines.
Strategy: Prioritize tasks, break down projects into smaller manageable chunks, effective time management, and consider agile methodologies for flexibility.

2. Managing Changing Requirements
Challenge: Adapting to evolving project goals and client needs.
Strategy: Embrace flexibility, use version control systems, maintain clear communication channels, and involve stakeholders in the process.

3. Ensuring Software Quality
Challenge: Delivering bug-free, efficient, and scalable software.
Strategy: Implement thorough testing (unit, integration, system), code reviews, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and use of static analysis tools.

4. Keeping Up with Technology
Challenge: Staying updated with the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
Strategy: Continuous learning, attending conferences and workshops, online courses, experimenting with new technologies, and joining developer communities.   

5. Effective Teamwork and Communication

7. Work-Life Balance
Challenge: Maintaining a healthy work-life equilibrium.
Strategy: Time management, setting boundaries, prioritizing tasks, delegating when possible, and taking breaks.**

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
I.	Unit testing involves testing individual components, modules or units of the software, usually at the function or method level, in isolation from the rest of the system. These units are the smallest testable parts of an application, such as individual functions, methods, or classes

It’s important for: 
Early Bug Detection: Unit testing allows developers to identify and fix bugs early in the development process, which is often cheaper and less disruptive than fixing bugs later.
Code Quality: By verifying that each unit of code functions correctly, unit testing ensures that the building blocks of the software are reliable, leading to higher overall code quality.

II.	Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between different units, subsystems, components or modules of the software. It ensures that these components work together as expected when combined.

It’s important for: 
Early detection of Interface Issues: Integration testing identifies problems that may arise when different units are combined, such as mismatches in data formats, incorrect data flow, or improper handling of dependencies.
Verification of Module Interactions: It ensures that integrated components interact correctly according to the system’s requirements, which is crucial for the software’s overall functionality.

III.	System testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements. It focuses on the complete and integrated application, including all modules, components, and subsystems.

It’s important for: 
Validating System Behaviour: System testing ensures that the complete system behaves as expected and meets the functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and usability.
Prepares system for Production: By validating the system in an environment that closely resembles the production environment, system testing helps ensure that the software will perform well when deployed.

IV.	Acceptance Testing is the final level of testing performed to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for delivery to the customer or end-users. It is often conducted by the customer or a quality assurance team representing the customer.

It’s important for: 
Ensuring Business Requirements Are Met: Acceptance testing verifies that the software meets the business requirements and user expectations, ensuring that it delivers the value promised.
Final Validation: It serves as the last checkpoint before the software is released, providing confidence that the software is ready for production use.**

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
**Prompt Engineering involves crafting, refining, and optimizing input prompts given to large language models in a way that guides the model toward producing specific, accurate, and relevant responses.

Importance of prompt engineering 
Improving Accuracy and Relevance- A well-crafted prompt helps the AI understand what is being asked increasing the chances of getting a precise and correct answer.
Optimizing for Desired Outcomes: prompt engineering allows users to steer the model towards a particular style, tone, or type of response
Enhancing Usability and Efficiency: A well-designed prompt reduces the need for multiple attempts to get the desired response, saving time and making the interaction more efficient.
Addressing Ethical Considerations: By carefully crafting prompts, users can help mitigate the potential for biased or inappropriate responses from the AI, ensuring the outputs are ethical and aligned with societal norms.
Enabling Advanced Interactions: For tasks that require logical reasoning or multi-step problem-solving, prompt engineering can guide the AI through the necessary steps, ensuring each part of the task is addressed sequentially and correctly.**

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
**Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."

Improved prompt: "Provide a detailed explanation of how block-chain technology works and its potential applications in finance."

The enhanced prompt can be considered an improved one as it concretely instructs the AI so that the response corresponds to the person's wishes. Through the identification of the data that needs to be given and therefore being quick and to the point, the query is solved in less time, and the number of relevant answers is also higher.**
